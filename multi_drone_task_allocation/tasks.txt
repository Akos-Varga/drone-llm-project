t1 = f"""TASK:
Scan a rooftop for heat signatures using thermal imaging from 5 meters above the rooftop.
Thermal images should be taken at every 5 meters in a grid pattern across the rooftop area.
If any location reports a maximum temperature of 37.0°C or higher, a second drone should capture a high-resolution image (≥21 MP) of that location from the same altitude.
All drones should return to the starting position and land when the task is completed.

ENVIRONMENT:
- Rooftop is a square with corners at [50, 50, 20], [70, 50, 20], [70, 70, 20], [50, 70, 20]
- Drones start at [0, 0, 0]
- Mission time: ~35 minutes
"""

t2 = f"""TASK:
Inspect all four sides of a circular tower using 4 drones with onboard computers. 
Each drone should stay 2 meters away from the surface of the tower and take images every 1 meter in height from 1m to 10m.
Each drone should yaw to face the tower center while capturing images.
All drones should return to the starting position and land when the task is completed.

ENVIRONMENT:
- Tower height: 10 meters
- Tower base-center: [10, 2, 0]
- Tower radius: 2 meters
- Drones start at [0, 0, 0]
- Mission time: ~5 minutes
